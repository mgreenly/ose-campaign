## Rumors

1. "The hermit, old Thaddeus, used to come down every week for supplies. Haven't seen him since the new moon. His winter mushrooms cure any poison - worth their weight in silver to the herbalist."

2. "Trappers been seeing strange lights up in the foothills - blue and green, dancing like will-o'-wisps. And that singing... gives me the shivers just thinking about it."

3. "My grandmother always said there were cursed treasures buried in these hills, left by the old kings. Touch one, and you'll never be human again."

4. "Thaddeus found something up there, I'm sure of it. Last time I saw him, he was muttering about 'ancient protections' and buying more silver chains than any hermit needs."

5. "Dire rats been coming down from the mountains lately, big as dogs some of them. Never used to see them this far from the peaks. Something's stirring them up."
