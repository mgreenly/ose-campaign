# The Barrow of the Stone King

## Overview

**Hook:** Recent earthquakes have opened an ancient barrow mound near a local farm. The farmer's son ventured inside and returned babbling about "stone soldiers" before falling into a fevered sleep. The farmer offers his prize bull (worth 150 gold pieces) to anyone who can cure his son.

**Adventure:** The barrow contains the tomb of an ancient king. Animated skeletons guard the passages, and the king's burial chamber holds a Stone Guardian. The fever is caused by ancient spores that require a specific herb found in the tomb's garden chamber to cure.

**Arc Potential:** Disturbing the Stone King's rest has awakened other barrows in the region. Strange drums can be heard at night, and ancient dead begin to stir across Crownfoot.
