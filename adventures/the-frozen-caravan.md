# The Frozen Caravan

## Overview

**Hook:** A merchant caravan that was due two weeks ago never arrived from the northern pass. The Merchant Guild offers 100 gold pieces for information about the caravan's fate and recovery of the valuable spice shipment.

**Adventure:** Following the trade road north, the party discovers the caravan frozen in unnatural ice despite the season. Ice mephits have claimed the area, and a young white dragon wyrmling has made the nearby cave its temporary lair while hunting in Crownfoot.

**Arc Potential:** The wyrmling escaped from its parent's lair after stealing part of the hoard. The adult dragon will eventually come looking for both its offspring and its treasure.

## Rumors

1. "The Merchant Guild's keeping quiet about what was really in that caravan. Spices? Ha! I heard it was carrying something magical - that's why it never made it through the pass."

2. "Ice in summer? That ain't natural. My uncle was a ranger, said only dragon-magic could freeze a whole caravan solid like that. Mark my words, there's a white dragon in them peaks."

3. "The caravan master, Josiah Blackwater, he's done that run a hundred times. If he didn't make it through, something terrible happened. The Guild's offering 100 gold just for information!"

4. "A traveler at The Copper Kettle claimed he heard terrible screeching from the north pass two weeks back - like a thousand winter winds all at once."

5. "My cousin in Greyford says the Coldrun's been running colder than usual. Fish are dying, and ice forms on the banks even at midday. Something's changed up in the mountains."
