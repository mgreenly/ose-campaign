# The Frozen Caravan

## Overview

**Hook:** A merchant caravan that was due two weeks ago never arrived from the northern pass. The Merchant Guild offers 100 gold pieces for information about the caravan's fate and recovery of the valuable spice shipment.

**Adventure:** Following the trade road north, the party discovers the caravan frozen in unnatural ice despite the season. Ice mephits have claimed the area, and a young white dragon wyrmling has made the nearby cave its temporary lair while hunting in Crownfoot.

**Arc Potential:** The wyrmling escaped from its parent's lair after stealing part of the hoard. The adult dragon will eventually come looking for both its offspring and its treasure.
