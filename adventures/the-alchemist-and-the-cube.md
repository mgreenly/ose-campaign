# The Alchemist and the Cube

## Overview

**Hook:** A reclusive alchemist in a nearby town is obsessed with creating a universal solvent. He believes the acidic secretions of a Gelatinous Cube are the final ingredient he needs. He offers a handsome reward and three Potions of Healing for a safely contained sample.

**Adventure:** The party is directed to the abandoned ruins of a wizard's tower, where a Gelatinous Cube was last sighted. The ruins are unstable and filled with minor traps. The party must navigate the crumbling tower, find the Cube, and survive the encounter to extract the sample.

**Arc Potential:** The alchemist successfully creates the solvent, but it is too powerful. It begins to dissolve everything in his workshop, and threatens to eat through the floor into the town's sewers. The party must now contain the spreading ooze before it contaminates the water supply.

## Rumors

1. "That old wizard's tower has been abandoned for decades. They say the wizard tried to turn lead into gold but created something that ate through his entire laboratory floor."

2. "The alchemist? Master Aldric? He's obsessed, I tell you. Keeps muttering about 'universal solvent' and how it'll make him rich enough to buy a shop in Greyford proper."

3. "My nephew's a trapper - says he won't go near that ruined tower anymore. Found animal bones there, all cleaned white as snow, not a scrap of meat left. Unnatural, if you ask me."

4. "Three healing potions! That's worth more than gold in these parts. Just don't let that cube touch you - I heard it dissolved a whole cow once, left nothing but the bell."

5. "They say gelatinous cubes can't be killed with normal weapons - just pass right through 'em. Better bring fire, or better yet, don't go at all. That tower's foundation is rotten with age."
