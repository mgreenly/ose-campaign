### Summary of Classic Adventure Gaming

Classic Adventure Gaming is a style of play distinct from modern "roleplaying games" (RPGs), rooted in the principles of early editions like the 1st Edition AD&D rulebooks. It prioritizes player skill, strategic gameplay, and emergent outcomes over collaborative storytelling and character impersonation.

Key tenets include:

*   **Player-Centric, Not Character-Centric:** Players interact as themselves, using their own wits to navigate challenges. While "metagaming"—using player knowledge—is encouraged as a sign of mastery, players are expected to justify their actions within the game's fiction. For example, a player knows fire hurts trolls, but they should be able to explain *why their character knows this*, perhaps citing a story they heard or a book they read. This ensures character actions remain plausible within their role, grounding player skill in the game world.

*   **GM as Neutral Arbiter:** The GM must *not* metagame. They are bound by the knowledge, goals, and resources of the NPCs and monsters they control. The GM's role is to create a persistent world with dynamic situations, not to write a pre-determined story for the players to follow.

*   **Campaign-Focused Play:** The game is built for long-term campaigns where the world evolves, with or without player intervention. Rulesets remain stable to allow for deep player understanding, and high-level play is the ultimate goal.

*   **Player Agency is Paramount:** Players drive the action and decide the group's course. The game thrives with proactive players who make decisions and accept the consequences. To maintain a fast pace, players may choose to either act out a conversation in-character or simply state their intent, such as, "I attempt to persuade the guard." This flexibility respects player comfort and keeps the game moving, discouraging long deliberations for perfect information.

*   **High-Resource Environment:** This is not a low-magic or "mudcore" style. Abundant treasure and powerful magic items are essential, as they provide players with the resources needed to exert their agency and develop a unique suite of "powers" that changes as items are found and lost.

In essence, Classic Adventure Gaming revives an early playstyle that values rigorous gaming over playacting. It's a demanding but rewarding approach for groups who enjoy strategic challenges and seeing their mastery of the game grow.
