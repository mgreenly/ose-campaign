# The Alchemist and the Cube

## Overview

**Hook:** A reclusive alchemist in a nearby town is obsessed with creating a universal solvent. He believes the acidic secretions of a Gelatinous Cube are the final ingredient he needs. He offers a handsome reward and three Potions of Healing for a safely contained sample.

**Adventure:** The party is directed to the abandoned ruins of a wizard's tower, where a Gelatinous Cube was last sighted. The ruins are unstable and filled with minor traps. The party must navigate the crumbling tower, find the Cube, and survive the encounter to extract the sample.

**Arc Potential:** The alchemist successfully creates the solvent, but it is too powerful. It begins to dissolve everything in his workshop, and threatens to eat through the floor into the town's sewers. The party must now contain the spreading ooze before it contaminates the water supply.
