# The Goblin Menace of Oakhaven

## Overview

**Hook:** The nearby village of Oakhaven is being terrorized by goblin raids. Livestock has been stolen and a farmer has gone missing. The village reeve offers 50 gold pieces to any group that can track the goblins to their lair and put an end to their raids.

**Adventure:** The party follows the tracks into the whispering woods, where they find a small, 5-room cave system. The dungeon is guarded by giant rats and contains a small goblin tribe, complete with a brutish chieftain. The party must defeat the goblins and rescue the missing farmer.

**Arc Potential:** On the goblin chieftain, the party finds a crudely drawn map showing a larger, more fortified position deeper in the mountains, marked with a skull. It seems this small tribe was merely an outpost for a much larger threat.
