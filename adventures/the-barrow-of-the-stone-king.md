# The Barrow of the Stone King

## Overview

**Hook:** Recent earthquakes have opened an ancient barrow mound near a local farm. The farmer's son ventured inside and returned babbling about "stone soldiers" before falling into a fevered sleep. The farmer offers his prize bull (worth 150 gold pieces) to anyone who can cure his son.

**Adventure:** The barrow contains the tomb of an ancient king. Animated skeletons guard the passages, and the king's burial chamber holds a Stone Guardian. The fever is caused by ancient spores that require a specific herb found in the tomb's garden chamber to cure.

**Arc Potential:** Disturbing the Stone King's rest has awakened other barrows in the region. Strange drums can be heard at night, and ancient dead begin to stir across Crownfoot.

## Rumors

1. "That barrow's been sealed for centuries! My grandfather told me the Stone Kings were buried with their armies, turned to living stone to guard them in death."

2. "Young Tom, the farmer's boy, he's burning up with fever. Keeps mumbling about 'the garden of stones' and 'soldiers that don't bleed.' Poor lad might not make it."

3. "The earthquake that opened that barrow? Wasn't natural. Felt it here at The Copper Kettle - the ground didn't shake, it... twisted, like something underground was waking up."

4. "The farmer's prize bull is worth 150 gold at market! He must be desperate to offer it. That boy's his only son since the plague took the others."

5. "There's more than one barrow in these hills. The old folk say they're all connected underground, like a great tomb-city. If one's opened, the others know."
