# The Goblin Menace of Oakhaven

## Overview

**Hook:** The nearby village of Oakhaven is being terrorized by goblin raids. Livestock has been stolen and a farmer has gone missing. The village reeve offers 50 gold pieces to any group that can track the goblins to their lair and put an end to their raids.

**Adventure:** The party follows the tracks into the whispering woods, where they find a small, 5-room cave system. The dungeon is guarded by giant rats and contains a small goblin tribe, complete with a brutish chieftain. The party must defeat the goblins and rescue the missing farmer.

**Arc Potential:** On the goblin chieftain, the party finds a crudely drawn map showing a larger, more fortified position deeper in the mountains, marked with a skull. It seems this small tribe was merely an outpost for a much larger threat.

## Rumors

1. "Old farmer Holwick swears he saw goblins dragging something big into the Whispering Woods three nights ago - looked like a person wrapped in burlap."

2. "The reeve's offering 50 gold, but I heard a merchant at The Copper Kettle say he'd pay double that for any goblin ears - apparently they're worth something to alchemists in Greyford."

3. "My cousin says the goblins only started raiding after those earthquakes last month. Maybe something drove them out of their deeper caves in the Stonecrown Peaks?"

4. "The missing farmer? That's Willem Greystone. His daughter says he went out to check on strange lights near the forest edge and never came back."

5. "I've heard tell that goblins in these parts worship something in the mountains - they paint skull symbols with charcoal and blood. Best not go looking for their lair after dark."
